    Note that this platform is very much a development project. I did because I
    wanted a CMS that would be easy to consume through API and I thought it
    would be fun. But it's bound to be unreliable and break from time to time.
    I'll do my best to keep it working, though if you require something more
    <i>serious</i> then check out one of the many other guestbook services.

    This service free. I don't plan on adding any paid plan in the forseeable
    future, and if I do all current users will remain free forever (or at least
    as long as the platform exists).
